## Project Overview :

### Space Mission Prediction
Predicting the success rate of space missions using machine-learning models. 
This project explores various models to analyze and predict factors influencing the success of space missions. 
By leveraging features such as mission cost, duration, and distance from Earth,the models aim to provide actionable insights for optimizing mission planning and resource allocation.

## Problem Description: 

Space missions involve significant complexity and high costs, making their success crucial for scientific advancement and resource efficiency. 
Accurately predicting the success rate of missions is essential for informed decision-making and risk management. 
This project leverages historical space mission data to identify critical factors driving mission success, enabling a data-driven approach to optimize planning and execution.

The goal is to develop a machine-learning model that can accurately predict mission success percentages based on 
features like mission cost, duration, distance from Earth, and scientific yield.
This solution has the potential to optimize decision-making processes in future space missions and reduce the risk of failures.

## Dataset Details
